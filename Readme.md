# NOT MAINTAINED, LOOKING FOR NEW PROJECT OWNER

**It's been a while since I've been able to spend some time on this repo and I prefer to transfer it to someone that can do a better job at maintaining it than I am doing right now. If you are interested, please let me know right away at jpadilla1293@gmail.com**

**Take a look at [react-native-charts-wrapper](https://github.com/wuxudong/react-native-charts-wrapper) it's a library inspired by this one and by [react-native-mp-android-chart](https://github.com/mskec/react-native-mp-android-chart).**

# Introduction

The aim of this library is to provide reusable React Native components that can graph charts like Bar, Line, Scatter, Combined, Pie, Candle, Bubble from the awesome ios-charts library.

# Installation

**The minimum deployment target should be set to iOS 8.0 or greater**

1. Run `npm install --save react-native-ios-charts`
2. Add all the files under node_modules/react-native-ios-charts/RNiOSCharts. (In Xcode: File -> Add files to "App Name")
3. When you add the files XCode should prompt you to create a bridging header if you haven't done so already. Create it and import the `RCTViewManager.h`. It should look something like this.

  ```Objective-C
  #import "RCTBridge.h"
  #import "RCTViewManager.h"
  #import "RCTUIManager.h"
  #import "UIView+React.h"
  ```
3.5. You can use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) and skip steps 4-6. Just add a `Podfile` to your ios directory with the following content. Then run `pod install` and open the generated .xcworkspace from now on in xcode.

  ```
  use_frameworks!

  target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'SwiftyJSON', git: 'https://github.com/IBM-Swift/SwiftyJSON.git'
    pod 'Charts', git: 'https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts.git'
  end
  
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '3.0'
      end
    end
  end
  ```
4. Install [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) and [iOS Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts) libraries and add `SwiftyJSON.xcodeproj` and `Charts.xcodeproj` files to your project.
5. Under `Build Phases`, under `Link Binary With Libraries`, click the plus sign and add `SwiftyJSON.framework` and `Charts.framework`.
6. Add the `SwiftyJSON.framework` and `Charts.framework` to the `Embedded Binaries` section in your app.
7. In your project's build settings, go to build options and change the `Embedded Content Contains Swift Code` to `Yes`.

          config={{
            dataSets: [{
              values: [1, 2, 3, 10],
              colors: ['green'],
              label: '2015',
            }, {
              values: [3, 2, 1, 5],
              colors: ['red'],
              label: '2014',
            }],
            labels: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
          }}
          style={styles.chart}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }
});

var styles = StyleSheet.create({
  chart: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200
  }
})
```
